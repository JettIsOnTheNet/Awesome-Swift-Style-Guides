# Swift-Style-Guides
### A list of Style Guides for Swift Programming Language.

Swift is a reliable and efficient language that is well-suited for building apps on Apple platforms. Its focus on safety, simplicity, and integration with Apple frameworks make it a top choice for developers of all skill levels.

One *major disadvantage* of Swift however is that it does not have an in-depth Style Guide. The guide provided by Swift.org leaves a lot open to interpretation. This can lead to inconsistency in the way code is written which can become especially problematic in large projects with multiple contributors. The less time and effort you have to spend ensuring that the codebase is cohesive, the better.

An in-depth Style Guide helps establish a common language and set of best practices that everyone on the team can follow, making it easier to collaborate and maintain the code over time. If you are learning Swift, I suggest to follow a Style Guide while learning. It makes your code 10x better, from day 1 and you will become fingertoppsk√§nsla (expert) in no time.

Below are links to Style Guides that you may find useful. They are constantly evolving, so be sure to bookmark them.

My favorite Style Guide is provided by [Google](https://github.com/google), however [Airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb) or [Linkedin](https://github.com/linkedin) Style Guides are just as good choice.
